My dear bestie/palku/ sissy
“Tera mujhse hai pehle ka naata koi, yun hi nahi dil lubhata koi!”

Many, many happy returns of the day to you and the nanhi jaan inside you. You are one year wiser today, and this year is going to be the most special one for you, as your miniature version is on the way. I am so happy for you! I want the baby eyes on you waise… ( sorry Anjum 🙃)

I wish our love that started over aloo ka parantha keeps making us fatter and fatter as we age.
Lots of love!
