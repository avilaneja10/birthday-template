Happy Birthday to the cutest sister and soon-to-be coolest mom.
This year feels extra special because it is probably the last birthday where the cake is all yours. Next year, your little partner will be here to steal the show and the frosting. But do not worry, we will make sure to remind them how much fun their mom used to be before the sleepless nights begin.

We love you and are so excited to celebrate you and the little one soonğŸ©·ğŸ©·ğŸ©·ğŸ©·ğŸ©·
